Prologue
I AM A LITTLE BOY, running through the fields as fast as I can. I feel
myself pursued by some invisible force, as though life itself is chasing
me. The race to see my dreams come true consumes me. Still, I find
myself distracted by the beautiful sunflowers along the path, tempting
me with their promises.
I look back at the field now, trying to see my past, but everything is
just a cloudy haze.
The beginning of my life was miserable by any standards. I grew up
in an orphanage with life’s deck stacked against me. Still, I did my best
to enjoy that life and create success where I could. Whenever I walked
the streets naively enjoying the day, I always liked to imagine what was
behind the faces of strangers passing by, trying to read them as I might
read a book. I enjoyed watching a mother walking the street hand-in-
hand with her child because I knew it was a priceless commodity to
have. I savored the sight of two brothers hugging each other or two
lovers holding hands frozen in a moment of endless love. Most of all,
I held faith in my parents, silently hoping they would come back for
me.
I sought ways to bear the loneliness around me, but it wasn’t
easy. Being alone in a crowded place is not the kind of solitude that
inspires youth. Many of the lonely souls around me—those left by
parents who should have naturally given the purest unconditional
affection—believed it was their fault for being rejected or left alone.
