    "tagline": "A powerful and emotional LGBTQ memoir of resilience, identity, and survival — from a Ukrainian orphanage during the Cold War to finding freedom and belonging",
    "short_synopsis": "This inspirational survival memoir begins in the shadows of a crumbling Soviet system - a small boy abandoned to a harsh Ukrainian orphanage. But this is more than a story of trauma and healing. It's one of the most uplifting LGBTQ books for adults about reclaiming self-worth and overcoming adversity.",
    "full_description": "The inspiring story of a Ukrainian orphanage resident, Vitaly, who overcame adversity and achieved his dreams is a testament to the power of determination and self-belief. Vitaly's journey demonstrates that, regardless of life's challenges, one can accomplish anything with unwavering dedication and a strong belief in oneself.\n\nVitaly's memoir begins in a Ukrainian orphanage during the USSR era. His autobiography tells the story of growing up without parents and being in foster care. Despite these challenges, Vitaly refused to let his circumstances define him. Through determination, he overcame obstacles to become successful.\n\nRaised behind iron bars and silence, Vitaly was left by his mother at the age of six. He would spend the next 12 years navigating hunger, foster care, isolation, and emotional abuse - followed by the challenge of growing up gay in a world that didn't want him to exist. In a time and place where queerness was taboo and compassion was scarce, he dared to ask: 'Who am I, really?'\n\nNow, in his own voice, Vitaly tells his remarkable truth. This is not just an adoption story. This is a fierce coming-of-age LGBTQ memoir about reclaiming identity and rising from childhood trauma.",

      "source": "Laura, Goodreads",
      "excerpt": "When I purchased this book, I thought it would be another empathetic life story. Oh boy, how wrong I was! 'Vitaly' turned out to be the best book I've read in years. I always believe true stories are far more exciting and interesting than Fiction. I wasn't the same person when I finished reading, and I could feel the transformation. It's nothing short of magic."

      "rating": 5,
      "source": "Goodreads Reviewer",
      "excerpt": "There's an especial poignancy in reading this book right now as war rages in Ukraine (June 2022) but it would make for poignant reading at any time... it's no misery memoir, but a clear-sighted and largely non-judgmental account of his life. Highly recommended."

    {
      "rating": 5,
      "source": "Goodreads Reviewer",
      "excerpt": "I think this book is deeply moving and truly inspiring, a transformational journey... Once you reach the end of the book, you will feel that you are a changed person, and not the same person who started reading. 'Vitaly' is not another autobiography, it's a transformational journey."

      "source": "Arthur B., Biochemistry Consultant",
      "excerpt": "This book really resonated with me. The feelings of being 'different' very much mirrored my own feelings growing up. And the way he described how he dealt with those feelings were also mine. Great!"

      "rating": 5,
      "source": "Doug Kirkpatrick",

    {
      "rating": 5,
      "source": "Rabia, Readersfavorite.com",
      "excerpt": "I was surprised by how the story affected me. Instead of using fancy vocabulary and overly-descriptive imagery, authors Vitaly used simple language that your average reader could understand. My favorite was Into Adulthood because that was when he had more awareness and fire to live a better life he could be proud of. I loved this book!"

      "rating": 4,
      "source": "Goodreads Reviewer",
      "excerpt": "I enjoyed reading this book, because it was not one of those 'I grew up in an orphanage and it was hell' books, but it gave a good view of what it was like growing up as a young boy in an orphanage in Ukraine, with all the ups and downs, but showing that there is a lot of optimism even in a situation like this."
