lovedwatchinghowfastsomegirlscoulddotheirtricks.
My best times were when I wasn’t around the house, watching
television,ordoingmyhomework. Iwantedtobeoutintheopen,
testing all the toys I made. Sometimes I had Slavik’s help, and
sometimesIwasbymyself.Eitherway,thosewerethemomentswhen
nothingelsearoundmeexisted,themomentswhereIwasalonewith
mythoughts,inventing,andcreatingfromscrapsofoutcastmaterial.

Although many of our games revolved around shooting and ex-

One of the games we enjoyed playingtogether wasGorodki. In
Gorodki, we made a square-shaped area called a Gorodok, which
means‘thecity.’Insidethecity,wewouldsetupfivecylindricalpins

I began going to meetings towards the end of my first year at

people wouldn’t talk to each other. So I was surprised to see the

ThemeetingbeganwithPresidentRoman’snotes.Then,wesang
hymns and prayed before the sacrament. One of the young men
offering sacrament, a deacon in The Church, recited words that
weighedheavyonmyheart.“OGod,theEternalFather,weasktheein
