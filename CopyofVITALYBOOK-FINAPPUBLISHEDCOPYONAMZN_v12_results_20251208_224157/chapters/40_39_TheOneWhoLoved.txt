I began going to meetings towards the end of my first year at

people wouldn’t talk to each other. So I was surprised to see the

ThemeetingbeganwithPresidentRoman’snotes.Then,wesang
hymns and prayed before the sacrament. One of the young men
offering sacrament, a deacon in The Church, recited words that
weighedheavyonmyheart.“OGod,theEternalFather,weasktheein
